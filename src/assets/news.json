    "originalTitle": "Norway's PM agrees crown princess had 'poor judgement' over Epstein links",
    "title": "A Royal Lesson: Being Careful Who You Meet",
    "content": "<h3>Hello from Africa, little explorers!</h3>\nGuess what? News happens all over the world, even in a faraway land called Norway! Today, we have a story about a very special person from Norway. Her name is Princess Mette-Marit. She is a real-life princess! Isn't that exciting?\n\nNorway is a beautiful country far, far away from Africa. It has mountains, snow, and sometimes even a special light show in the sky called the Northern Lights! It's very cold there, unlike our sunny weather sometimes. In Norway, they have a King and Queen, and their children are princesses and princes, just like in some of our stories.\n\nPrincess Mette-Marit is going to be the Queen of Norway one day! Wow! That means she has a very important job. She helps her country and tries to be a good example for everyone. When you are a princess, many people look up to you. They watch what you do and listen to what you say.\n\n<h3>A Friend Who Was Not Good</h3>\nSometimes, even important people can make little mistakes. Princess Mette-Marit once met someone who was not a good person. This person had done some very, very bad things. When she met him, she didn't know how bad he was. She thought he was just a regular person. But later, everyone found out he was not good at all. He hurt people, and that is a terrible thing to do.\n\nIt’s like when you meet someone new at school or in your village. At first, you might think they are nice. But sometimes, as you get to know them, you might learn that they are not always kind or that they do things that are not good. It’s important to be careful who you spend your time with.\n\n<h3>What is \"Poor Judgement\"?</h3>\nWhen Princess Mette-Marit met this person, she made what grown-ups call \"poor judgement.\" This just means she didn't make the best choice about who to spend time with. She didn't think very carefully about it. Maybe she didn't know enough about him. It's like choosing to play near a big, deep puddle without thinking you might get wet or fall in!\n\nEveryone, even princesses, can sometimes make poor judgements. We all make mistakes! The important thing is what we do *after* we make a mistake. Do we learn from it? Do we try to do better next time? Yes, that's what Princess Mette-Marit did.\n\nDid you know? Making mistakes is a normal part of learning! It helps us grow smarter and make better choices in the future. Just like when you try to learn a new game, you might not get it right the first time, but you keep trying!\n\n<h3>The Prime Minister Agrees</h3>\nIn Norway, there is a very important helper for the King and Queen. He is like the main leader of the government. His name is Jonas Gahr Støre, and we call him the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister heard about Princess Mette-Marit meeting the person who was not good.\n\nHe agreed with Princess Mette-Marit. She had already said herself that it was a mistake to have met that person. The Prime Minister said that she showed good honesty by admitting her mistake. It takes courage to say, \"I made a poor choice.\"\n\nIt's good when grown-ups can talk about their mistakes. It teaches us that it's okay to say sorry and to learn. Nobody is perfect, not even a princess or a prime minister!\n\n<h3>Why It Matters for a Princess</h3>\nWhy is this story important? Well, because Princess Mette-Marit is a role model. A role model is someone who sets a good example for others. When you are a princess, many children and grown-ups around the world look at you. They want to see good things from you.\n\nIf a princess spends time with someone who has done bad things, even if she didn't know it at first, it can make people confused. They might wonder if it's okay to be friends with bad people. But it's not! We should always try to be kind, fair, and stay away from people who hurt others.\n\nDid you know? You can be a role model too! Every time you are kind to your friends, help your family, or work hard at school, you are being a wonderful role model for others around you. Isn't that a super power?\n\n<h3>Learning to Choose Our Friends Wisely</h3>\nThis story from Norway teaches us a very important lesson. It teaches us to be careful about who our friends are and who we spend our time with. It's good to be friendly to everyone, but our *close* friends should be people who are good, kind, and make us feel happy and safe.\n\nIf someone you know does things that are mean or wrong, it’s okay to not want to be close friends with them. It’s important to tell a trusted grown-up if someone is doing something bad, so that person can get help or stop hurting others.\n\nPrincess Mette-Marit has learned from her experience. She is still a good princess who cares about her country. She just learned a big lesson about being extra careful. And that's something we can all learn from.\n\nDid you know? Good friends are like sunshine! They make you feel warm, happy, and help you grow. Always choose your sunshine friends!\n\n<h3>A Story About Choices</h3>\nSo, this news item from faraway Norway is really a story about making choices. We all make choices every day, big and small. From what clothes to wear, to what to eat, to who to play with. Each choice helps us learn and grow.\n\nPrincess Mette-Marit made a choice that wasn't the best, but she learned from it, and she was brave enough to say so. That makes her an even stronger princess!\n\nThe most important thing is to always try our best, learn from our mistakes, and choose to be kind and good. That's a lesson for everyone, no matter if you're a princess or a super kid in Africa! Keep shining bright!",
